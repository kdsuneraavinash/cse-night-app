*Bhawana*
The ones who listen will often capture
Heavenly melodies as they float down.

*Abandoned Iron auditorium*
It stands tall overlooking spirited moves
And weeps for its unfulfilled destiny.

*Posh canteen*
The walls themselves are made of their dreams;
Yet its what's inside they dream of after dreariest times.

*Exam hall*
They say the battles fought here are the hardest,
For the sole foe you meet here is yourself.

*Old gym*
Amidst the graceful footsteps and forgotten victories, 
The rustle of papers is heard once in a while.

*Apaye entrance eka*
Beware, for beyond these gates burns love,
Brighter than the flames it's known for.
